The air filled with the roar of jet engines, the screeches of the lizards, and the explosive bursts of weaponry. All those years of playing flight simulators paid off. After shooting a few of them down, the rest dispersed. As sand rose to the highest mountain top, to his surprise he saw that Grizzled Fang was nowhere to be seen. ‘Well.. better not to push my luck too far’ - Sandy thought.
